Hello! As an exercise in creative futility, this is a website dedicated to documenting my thoughts on the various ROMHacks and Fangames I've played. Given they occupy a worrying portion of my brain, quarantining my thoughts here seems to me to be the best way to deal with this. Although unlikely, if you're anyone but me reading this, then hello and welcome! In the much more likely case that you're me...start working on your thesis before it's too late.
